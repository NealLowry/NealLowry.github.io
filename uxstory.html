                    <h2>Overview / Problem Statement</h2>

                    <p>
                        Our UX story is centered around the development of a <b>baby health tracking application</b>.
                        This project was inspired by the experiences of our teammate who recently welcomed a <b>newborn</b> into his family.
                        During the early ideation stages, he expressed his concerns about managing essential tasks like <b>feedings</b>
                        and <b>diaper changes</b>, as these responsibilities must be constantly monitored. This firsthand insight highlighted
                        the need for a <b>simple</b>, <b>user-friendly solution</b> to help <b>parents</b> and <b>caregivers</b> track their <b>newborn's health</b> and 
                        care plans.

                        <b><i>Problem Statement:</i></b>
                        Parents with <b>newborns</b> have trouble identifying their baby's needs because each child's needs 
                        are unique and must be carefully tended to. <b>New parents</b> have no experience raising a child and are more likely 
                        to feel <b>overwhelmed</b>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Our company <b>PopcornGuitars Co.</b> is developing a <b>baby tracking application</b> to help <b>caregivers</b> 
                        maintain their baby's health in addition to their own <b>mental health</b> by suggesting appropriate <b>care tips</b> or <b>plans</b>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b><i>My role:</i></b> Throughout this project, I was primarily tasked with user research and designing UX artifacts such as low and mid
                        fidelity prototypes.

                    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                    <p>While conducting competitive analysis, we evaluated several existing solutions on the app store to identify gaps and opportunites
                        Our main insights revealed that most competitors did not fully support single-handed use, which is crucial for busy parents who 
                        often have their hands full. Additionally, we found that parental resources, such as educational tips or guides, were generally lacking
                        or were not completely integrated within the app. These findings highlighted significant areas for improvement and helped guide our design
                        process to better meet the needs of users.

                    <h2>User Survey</h2>
                    <p>To gather parent attitudes, experiences, and wants, my teammates created a survey and got 7 responses. They also conducted one interview. 
                        After examining the results, we found that besides tracking their baby's health behaviors, users also inquired for resources to better 
                        take care of themselves during tumultous times. All parents responded that they felt they needed more help taking care of their baby and felt 
                        extremely sleep deprived and tired.</p>

                    <h2>User Personas</h2>
                    <p>To ensure that our design met the needs of target users, we created personas based off our survey data to represent different user groups.
                        Our primary insight was the importance of alleviating stress and anxiety for caregivers through a simple and intuitive design. By emphasizing 
                        ease of use and accessibility, our design attempts to help caregivers efficiently manage their responsibilities, but also offers peace of mind 
                        through reliable and straightforward functionality.

                    <h2>Sketches / Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>Initially, we began prototyping with Creative 8s to brainstorm some possible features. One feature that we agreed on was a simple
                        carousel view that could be easily navigated using only one hand. Eventually, these sketches were formalized into low-fidelity 
                        prototypes using Figma. After a round of revisions, my teammates created high-fidelity and interactive prototypes for the application.
